# ZedBox is now version 1.1 #

## The Flash Player 9 branch is now available in the SVN branch. ##

The native 3D API in Flash Player 10 forces display objects to be cached as bitmaps. If you use this built-in 3D feature to create billboard (2.5D) effects, it's kind of an overkill. ZedBox provides an easy interface to create 2.5D effects, and it doesn't force display objects to be cached as bitmaps.
